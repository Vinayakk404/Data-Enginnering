# ETL Pipeline using Weather Api
Here we have created an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline using Airflow.

- **Validate Open Weather API Endpoint**
  - First, we check if the Open Weather API endpoint is valid.

- **Extract Data from Open Weather API**
  - Then, the data is extracted from the Open Weather API.

- **Transform Data**
  - The extracted data is then transformed to a suitable format in Python.

- **Load Data to Amazon S3**
  - Next, we convert the transformed data into a CSV file and store it in Amazon S3.
